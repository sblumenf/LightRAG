LightRAG is a lightweight Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation system.
It supports multiple LLM backends and provides efficient document processing.

The system uses a schema-driven approach to build knowledge graphs from text documents.
Entities and relationships are extracted based on the schema definition.

This sample document should be used for testing the basic functionality of LightRAG,
including document loading, chunking, and retrieval.
