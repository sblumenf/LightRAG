## Phase 3 Integration with LightRAG Pipeline

Phase 3 implements advanced knowledge graph refinement capabilities that improve the quality of the knowledge graph through entity resolution and index synchronization. The implementation enhances the knowledge graph after initial construction and ensures consistency between the graph storage and vector storage.

### Integration Details

1. **Integration Point**: The entity resolution and index synchronization components are integrated with LightRAG's knowledge graph operations.

2. **Data Flow**: The entity resolution system identifies and merges duplicate entities in the knowledge graph, while the index synchronization system ensures that changes to the graph are reflected in the vector storage.

3. **Pipeline Modification**: The implementation extends LightRAG's storage classes with synchronization capabilities and adds new components for entity resolution.

- The index synchronization system includes a `KGIndexSynchronizer` class for managing synchronization between graph storage and vector storage, and a `SyncAwareNeo4JStorage` class that extends Neo4JStorage with automatic synchronization capabilities.
- The implementation handles various edge cases and errors gracefully, including missing entities, storage errors, and concurrent updates.
- The system supports both scheduled synchronization and event-based synchronization, with configurable batch sizes and intervals.
