   - Advanced interactive features and 3D support

## 6. Testing Considerations

### 6.1 Tests That Should Not Be Developed Right Now

Based on our recent testing efforts, the following test areas should be deferred or approached with caution:

1. **Regex-Heavy Tests in Formula Extractor**
   - **Issue**: Tests that mock regex functions (like `re.sub`) are causing instability in the test suite
   - **Reason**: The complex regex patterns used in LaTeX processing are difficult to mock correctly
   - **Alternative**: Focus on testing the outcomes rather than the internal regex processing
   - **Example**: Instead of mocking `re.sub` to test error handling, test with real inputs that exercise the error handling paths

2. **PIL-Dependent Tests Without Proper Environment**
   - **Issue**: Tests for image generation that depend on specific PIL functionality are brittle
   - **Reason**: Different environments may have different PIL capabilities or missing fonts
   - **Alternative**: Focus on testing the interface and error handling, not the specific rendering
   - **Example**: Test that the image generation function returns None when PIL is not available, rather than testing specific rendering paths

3. **Tests That Depend on External LLM Services**
   - **Issue**: Tests that require actual LLM API calls are unreliable in CI environments
   - **Reason**: API keys may not be available, rate limits may be hit, or responses may change
   - **Alternative**: Use mocks for LLM services and focus on testing the integration points
   - **Example**: Test that the formula description generator falls back to rule-based descriptions when LLM is unavailable

4. **Tests With Complex PDF Parsing Dependencies**
   - **Issue**: Tests that require specific PDF parsing capabilities are environment-dependent
   - **Reason**: PDF libraries like PyMuPDF may have different behaviors across platforms
   - **Alternative**: Use simple, controlled PDF fixtures and mock complex parsing operations
   - **Example**: Test diagram extraction with mocked PDF objects rather than real parsing

5. **Tests With Timing Dependencies**
   - **Issue**: Tests that depend on specific timing or performance characteristics are flaky
   - **Reason**: Different environments have different performance profiles
   - **Alternative**: Test functionality without timing assertions
   - **Example**: Test that a function completes successfully rather than that it completes within a specific time frame

### 6.2 Recommended Testing Focus

Instead of the above areas, testing efforts should focus on:

1. **Core Business Logic**: Test the core functionality without external dependencies
2. **Interface Contracts**: Test that functions accept and return the expected data structures
3. **Error Handling**: Test that errors are handled gracefully and appropriate fallbacks are used
4. **Configuration Options**: Test that different configuration options produce the expected behavior changes
5. **Integration Points**: Test that components integrate correctly, using mocks for external services

By focusing on these areas, we can build a more robust test suite that provides confidence in the system's behavior without being brittle or environment-dependent.

## Conclusion

These enhancements would significantly extend the capabilities of the diagram and formula extraction functionality implemented in Task 1.5. By focusing on LLM integration, performance optimization, UI/UX improvements, and format expansion, LightRAG can provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly experience for working with technical and visual content.

The modular design of the current implementation provides a solid foundation for these enhancements, allowing for incremental improvements without requiring a complete redesign of the existing functionality.
