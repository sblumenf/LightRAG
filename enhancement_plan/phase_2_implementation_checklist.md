## Phase 2 Integration with LightRAG Pipeline

Phase 2 implements schema-driven knowledge graph construction that builds on the enhanced document processing capabilities from Phase 1. The implementation enhances the chunking, embedding, and graph construction stages of LightRAG's pipeline.

### Integration Details

1. **Integration Point**: The enhanced chunking, embedding, and graph construction functions from Phase 2 are integrated into LightRAG's existing pipeline.

2. **Data Flow**: The enhanced chunking module takes processed documents from Phase 1 as input and outputs chunks with metadata. The schema classification module then classifies these chunks according to the schema. The schema-aware graph storage module then creates a knowledge graph from the classified chunks.

3. **Pipeline Modification**: The implementation enhances the existing pipeline by adding schema-driven knowledge graph construction capabilities without replacing the core pipeline structure.

### Implementation Notes

- The Phase 2 implementation enhances the existing chunking, embedding, and graph construction stages of LightRAG's pipeline.
- The enhanced text chunking module supports multiple chunking strategies and properly handles extracted elements from Phase 1.
- The embedding generation module adapts to different embedding providers and ensures proper embedding generation for chunks.
- The schema classification module classifies chunks according to the schema and extracts schema-defined properties.
- The schema-aware graph storage module validates entities and relationships against the schema and handles tentative entities and relationships.
- The implementation preserves the existing pipeline structure while enhancing its capabilities, following the principle of "Integration, Not Replacement" mentioned in the overall enhancement context.
