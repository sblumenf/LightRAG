# Enhanced LightRAG Implementation Plan (AI Assistant Guided with Incremental & Mandatory Testing)

## Project Goal:
Enhance the existing LightRAG system by implementing the features detailed in `overview.txt`, utilizing a **pre-existing `schema.json`**, focusing on improved document processing, schema-driven KG construction, advanced entity resolution, intelligent retrieval, sophisticated generation (CoT), and ensuring **full, passing test coverage** at each phase.

## AI Assistant Usage Guidelines:
*   **Provide Full Context:** For each prompt, provide the AI with:
    *   The prompt text itself.
    *   The *content* of any referenced script files (e.g., `graphrag_tutor/document_processing/pdf_parser.py`).
    *   Relevant snippets of existing LightRAG code (e.g., class definitions, function signatures, data structures from `lightrag/base.py`, `lightrag/operate.py`, relevant storage implementations).
    *   The **existing `schema.json`** file.
    *   Clear instructions on the desired output format or interface modifications.
*   **Iterative Development & Testing:** Implement features in small, testable units. Use the AI to generate code *and* corresponding test cases.
*   **Critical Review:** Treat AI-generated code *and* tests as a draft. Review carefully for correctness, efficiency, style, **robust error handling**, and adherence to LightRAG's **multi-backend architecture**. Refactor as needed.
*   **Mandatory Testing:** **All generated unit and integration tests must pass without warnings or skips before moving to the next task or phase.** Ensure comprehensive coverage of functionality and edge cases. Supplement mock LLM tests with targeted tests using real LLM calls during integration/E2E phases.
*   **Adapt, Don't Just Copy:** Guide the AI to adapt logic into LightRAG's framework, using its existing interfaces (`BaseGraphStorage`, etc.). Ensure generated core logic remains **backend-agnostic**.

## Recommendation:
Work on a dedicated feature branch in your forked Git repository (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/enhanced-pipeline`).

        Requirements: Use LLM: extract Intent (predefined list), Key Entities, Keywords, optional Expanded Terms. Return dict. **Handle LLM errors gracefully.**
        Output: Python async function code.
        --- AI PROMPT END ---
        ```
    *   **User Actions:** Implemented comprehensive query processing module in `lightrag/query_processing/query_analyzer.py`. Created `process_query` function that uses LLM to extract intent, entity types, keywords, and expanded terms from user queries. Added robust error handling for LLM failures.
    *   **Testing:** Implemented and verified **passing** unit tests with mock LLM, various query types, edge cases (empty queries, very long queries), and error handling. All tests pass without warnings or skips.
    *   **Completion Notes:** Successfully implemented robust query processing with comprehensive error handling. The implementation includes a process_query function that analyzes user queries to extract intent, entity types, keywords, and expanded terms. The function handles LLM errors gracefully, retrying failed calls and returning default values if all retries fail. The implementation also includes a response parser that can handle various LLM response formats and extract the required information.

        Context: Integrate into `LightRAG.aquery`.
        Task: Modify `aquery` method.
        Requirements: Call `process_query`, then `select_retrieval_strategy`. Use *selected strategy* to route to internal logic. Optionally pass extracted keywords/entities.
        Output: Modified Python code for `aquery`.
        --- AI PROMPT END ---
        ```
    *   **User Actions:** Modified `aquery` method in `lightrag/lightrag.py` to use query processing and strategy selection. Updated `QueryParam` class in `lightrag/base.py` to include new fields for query processing. Added support for "auto" mode that automatically selects the best retrieval strategy.
    *   **Testing:** Implemented and verified **passing** integration tests for `aquery` with auto mode, entity filtering, result reranking, and error handling. All tests pass without warnings or skips.
    *   **Completion Notes:** Successfully integrated query processing and strategy selection into LightRAG's query methods. The implementation modifies the aquery method to analyze queries, select the optimal retrieval strategy, and use the selected strategy to route to the appropriate internal logic. The implementation also passes extracted keywords and entity types to the retrieval functions for better results. The QueryParam class has been updated to include new fields for query processing, including use_intelligent_retrieval, query_analysis, filter_by_entity_type, and rerank_results.

        Output: Description and pseudocode.
        --- AI PROMPT END ---
        ```
    *   **User Actions:** Enhanced retrieval functions in `lightrag/operate.py` with entity type filtering and result re-ranking. Modified `naive_query` and `kg_query` functions to support filtering by entity types identified in query analysis and re-ranking based on keywords and intent.
    *   **Testing:** Implemented and verified **passing** unit and integration tests for filtering and re-ranking in both naive and kg query functions. Tests verify that filtering removes irrelevant results and re-ranking improves result order. All tests pass without warnings or skips.
    *   **Completion Notes:** Successfully implemented enhanced retrieval with entity type filtering and result re-ranking. The implementation modifies the naive_query and kg_query functions to filter results by entity types identified in query analysis and re-rank results based on keywords and intent. The filtering logic removes results that don't match the entity types, while the re-ranking logic scores results based on keyword matches, intent matches, and other criteria. The implementation includes configuration options for enabling/disabling filtering and re-ranking.
