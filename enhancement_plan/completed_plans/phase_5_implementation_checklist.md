## Phase 5 Integration with LightRAG Pipeline

Phase 5 implements advanced generation capabilities that enhance LightRAG's response quality through Chain-of-Thought reasoning, enhanced citation handling, and diagram/formula integration. The implementation builds on the intelligent retrieval capabilities from Phase 4.

### Integration Details

1. **Integration Point**: The advanced generation capabilities from Phase 5 are integrated into LightRAG's existing generation pipeline.

2. **Data Flow**: The retrieval results from Phase 4 are passed to the enhanced generation components, which apply Chain-of-Thought reasoning, process citations, and resolve diagram/formula placeholders to generate high-quality responses.

3. **Pipeline Modification**: The implementation enhances the existing generation pipeline without replacing the core pipeline structure, following the principle of "Integration, Not Replacement."
