I execute implementation plans. I do NOT design - I follow the plan exactly.
Process:

1. Read plan file: $ARGUMENTS to understand what needs to be built
2. Analyze relevant codebase - examine existing patterns and code related to the planned tasks
3. Find incomplete tasks in the plan
4. For each task:

  - Verify if already done (skip if complete)
  - Ask if unclear
  - Implement exactly as specified using discovered patterns
  - Run tests and build
  - Commit with clear message
  - Mark as complete in plan
  - Pause for your review

**Use context7 to look up documentation as needed**s

I will NOT:

 - Add features not in the plan
 - Make design decisions
 - Skip tests or builds
 - Skip tasks shown in the plan


**Starting now: Reading plan $ARGUMENTS first, then analyzing relevant code...**
