# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Integration of LLM Services for Diagram Description Generation

### 1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the requirements for enhancing LightRAG with the ability to automatically generate high-quality textual descriptions of diagrams extracted from study materials. This feature will ensure that knowledge contained in visual elements is properly captured and made available to students preparing for professional designation exams, improving the overall effectiveness of the AI tutor application.

### 2. Current State Analysis
Currently, LightRAG has some capabilities for diagram extraction via the `diagram_analyzer.py` module, but lacks the ability to generate comprehensive descriptions of these diagrams. This creates a knowledge gap where important visual information from study materials is not adequately captured for student learning. The system needs to be enhanced to identify diagrams, process them, and generate meaningful textual descriptions that accurately represent the diagram content.

### 3. Enhancement Specification

#### 3.1 Core Functionality
- **Diagram Recognition**: Enhance existing diagram recognition capabilities to detect various diagram types in study materials
- **LLM Integration**: Connect to LLM services to generate comprehensive descriptions of identified diagrams
- **Context Awareness**: Incorporate surrounding text and document context to improve the relevance of descriptions
- **Description Storage**: Store generated descriptions alongside the original diagrams for retrieval

#### 3.2 User Experience
- Students will receive comprehensive explanations of diagrams without requiring explicit requests
- Diagram descriptions will be presented alongside regular textual content during study sessions
- The system will provide contextually relevant explanations that connect diagram concepts to the broader study material

#### 3.3 Feature Details
- **Description Quality**: Descriptions should explain diagram purpose, key components, relationships, and significance
- **Technical Accuracy**: Ensure descriptions maintain technical accuracy specific to the professional exam content
- **Learning Focus**: Orient descriptions toward explaining concepts that are likely to appear in exams

### 4. Technical Requirements

#### 4.1 Diagram Processing Pipeline
- Enhance the existing `diagram_analyzer.py` to extract more data points from diagrams
- Implement pre-processing to optimize diagrams for LLM vision model analysis
- Support common diagram types in study materials (flowcharts, process diagrams, organizational charts, etc.)

#### 4.2 LLM Integration
- Implement adaptors for multiple LLM providers with vision capabilities (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Develop a specialized prompt template for diagram description generation
- Create fallback mechanisms if the primary LLM service is unavailable

#### 4.3 System Integration
- Integrate with the document processing workflow in `lightrag/document_processing/`
- Ensure compatibility with existing text chunking and knowledge extraction processes
- Implement a caching mechanism to avoid redundant description generation

#### 4.4 Data Model Changes
- Add a new data structure to store diagram metadata and descriptions
- Enhance the retrieval system to incorporate diagram descriptions in responses
- Update indexing to make diagram descriptions searchable

### 5. Implementation Plan

#### 5.1 Phase 1: Foundation
- Enhance diagram detection and extraction capabilities
- Design the LLM prompting system for diagram description
- Create initial integration with at least one LLM provider

#### 5.2 Phase 2: Core Functionality
- Implement contextual awareness for diagram descriptions
- Develop storage and indexing for diagram descriptions
- Create basic retrieval mechanisms for diagram descriptions

#### 5.3 Phase 3: Refinement
- Optimize LLM prompts for technical accuracy and educational value
- Implement multi-provider support with fallback mechanisms
- Add performance optimizations and caching

#### 5.4 Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- Conduct comprehensive testing with various diagram types
- Fine-tune description quality based on educational effectiveness
- Optimize for production performance

### 6. Success Metrics

#### 6.1 Technical Metrics
- **Diagram Detection Rate**: >95% of diagrams successfully detected and processed
- **Processing Time**: <3 seconds average processing time per diagram
- **Description Quality**: >90% accuracy rate in technical content
- **System Stability**: <0.1% failure rate in the diagram processing pipeline

#### 6.2 Educational Metrics
- **Knowledge Completeness**: Diagram information successfully incorporated into student responses
- **Learning Effectiveness**: Improved student understanding of concepts presented in diagrams
- **Student Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on diagram explanations

### 7. Testing Strategy

#### 7.1 Unit Testing
- Test diagram detection across various document formats
- Validate LLM integration components
- Verify description storage and retrieval

#### 7.2 Integration Testing
- Test the end-to-end diagram processing pipeline
- Verify seamless integration with existing document processing
- Validate retrieval of diagram descriptions during student queries

#### 7.3 Quality Assurance
- Review generated descriptions for technical accuracy
- Assess educational value of descriptions
- Perform performance testing under various load conditions

### 8. Risk Assessment

#### 8.1 Technical Risks
- **LLM Service Reliability**: Dependency on external LLM services may create availability issues
  - *Mitigation*: Implement multiple provider support and caching mechanisms
- **Quality Consistency**: Variations in description quality across different diagram types
  - *Mitigation*: Create specialized prompts for different diagram categories and implement review processes
- **Performance Overhead**: Additional processing may impact system performance
  - *Mitigation*: Implement asynchronous processing and optimize for efficiency

#### 8.2 Educational Risks
- **Description Accuracy**: LLM may generate plausible but technically inaccurate descriptions
  - *Mitigation*: Develop specialized prompts emphasizing accuracy and implement validation mechanisms
- **Context Misalignment**: Descriptions may not align perfectly with curriculum
  - *Mitigation*: Incorporate course-specific context in prompts when available

### 9. Conclusion
This enhancement will significantly improve the AI tutor's ability to help students prepare for professional exams by ensuring that valuable information contained in diagrams is properly extracted, described, and made available during the learning process. The implementation approach balances technical feasibility with educational effectiveness to create a seamless experience for students.
