# LightRAG Architecture Diagrams

This directory contains a series of architecture diagrams that illustrate the components, interactions, and data flows within the LightRAG system.

## Available Diagrams

1. [System Overview](01_system_overview.md) - High-level overview of the entire LightRAG system and its major components
2. [Component Interaction](02_component_interaction.md) - Class diagram showing the relationships between core components
3. [Data Flow](03_data_flow.md) - Flowchart depicting how data moves through the system
4. [Document Processing Pipeline](04_document_processing.md) - Sequence diagram showing the document processing workflow
5. [LLM Integration](05_llm_integration.md) - Detailed view of how LightRAG integrates with various LLM providers
6. [Knowledge Graph Storage](06_knowledge_graph_storage.md) - Visualization of storage options and their capabilities
7. [Query Processing](07_query_processing.md) - Sequence diagram illustrating the query processing flow

## How to Use These Diagrams

These diagrams use Mermaid syntax and can be viewed directly in GitHub's markdown renderer or any compatible Mermaid viewer. They are designed to provide progressively more detailed insights into different aspects of the LightRAG system.

- Start with the System Overview to understand the big picture
- Explore specific areas of interest through the more detailed diagrams
- Use the Component Interaction diagram to understand the class structure
- Reference the Data Flow diagram to understand how information moves through the system
- Review the Document Processing Pipeline and Query Processing diagrams to understand the two main workflows
- Refer to LLM Integration and Knowledge Graph Storage diagrams for implementation details

## About Mermaid

These diagrams use [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/) syntax, which is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create diagrams dynamically.

To view these diagrams locally with proper rendering:
- Use a Markdown editor with Mermaid support
- Use the Mermaid Live Editor at https://mermaid.live/
- Install a browser plugin for Mermaid rendering
