#   Detailed Implementation Plan: KGVisualizationPanel Enhancements

This plan details the implementation of interactive drill-down and lasso-to-lesson functionality, along with aesthetic considerations and progress tracking placeholders, for the `KGVisualizationPanel`.

##   Phase 1: Interactive Drill-Down

* **Task 1.1: Backend API Enhancement (Graph Data with Details)**

    * Description: Modify the backend API to provide detailed information about nodes and edges when requested.
    * Target File: `graphrag_tutor/api_server.py`, `graphrag_tutor/knowledge_graph/neo4j_kg_service.py` (and related files for data retrieval).
    * Micro-processes:

        1.  API Endpoint Modification:
            * Create a new API endpoint (e.g., `/graph/node/{node_id}`) to retrieve detailed information for a specific node.
            * Create a new API endpoint (e.g., `/graph/edge/{edge_id}`) to retrieve detailed information for a specific edge (if edge IDs are feasible; otherwise, consider alternative identification methods).
            * Modify the existing graph data retrieval endpoint to include unique identifiers for nodes and edges in the response. This is crucial for the frontend to request details.
        2.  Knowledge Graph Service Logic:
            * Implement the logic in the knowledge graph service to fetch node details (properties, connected nodes, etc.) and edge details (type of relationship, associated data, etc.) from Neo4j.
            * Consider caching frequently accessed node/edge details to improve performance.
        3.  Data Transformation:
            * Ensure the API returns data in a structured format (e.g., JSON) that the frontend can easily consume.
            * Define clear data structures for node details and edge details.
    * Verification:
        * Test the new API endpoints using tools like Swagger UI or Postman.
        * Verify that the endpoints return the correct data in the expected format.
        * Ensure that the existing graph data endpoint includes node/edge IDs.

* **Task 1.2: Frontend Implementation (Node/Edge Interaction)**

    * Description: Implement the interactive drill-down functionality in the `KGVisualizationPanel`.
    * Target File: `src/components/KGVisualizationPanel.tsx`
    * Micro-processes:

        1.  Event Handling:
            * Add event handlers to the `react-flow` component to detect node clicks and edge clicks.
        2.  Data Fetching:
            * When a node or edge is clicked, retrieve the corresponding ID and make a call to the appropriate backend API endpoint to fetch the details.
            * Implement loading states and error handling to provide a smooth user experience while fetching data.
        3.  UI Display:
            * Use a modal, tooltip, or a dedicated section within the panel to display the fetched details.
            * Present the information in a clear and organized manner, using Shadcn/ui components for styling[cite: 314, 315, 316, 317].
        4.  State Management:
            * Use Zustand to manage the state of the selected node/edge and its details[cite: 324, 325, 326, 327].
    * Verification:
        * Test node clicks and edge clicks.
        * Verify that the correct details are fetched and displayed.
        * Test loading states and error handling.
        * Ensure that the UI is responsive and user-friendly.

* **Task 1.3: Node and Edge Styling**

    * Description: Define a clear and consistent visual style for nodes and edges.
    * Target File: `src/components/KGVisualizationPanel.tsx`
    * Micro-processes:

        1.  Color Palette:
            * Choose a color palette that is both visually pleasing and informative.
            * Consider using color to represent different node types (e.g., concepts, processes, entities) or edge types (e.g., relationships, dependencies).
            * Ensure sufficient color contrast for accessibility[cite: 454, 455, 456, 457, 458].
        2.  Node Shapes and Icons:
            * Use different shapes or icons to further distinguish node types.
            * Keep the shapes simple and easily recognizable.
        3.  Edge Styles:
            * Use different line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) or arrowheads to indicate the direction and type of relationship.
            * Control edge thickness to avoid visual clutter.
        4.  Typography:
            * Select a legible font for node labels.
            * Use appropriate font sizes to ensure readability without overwhelming the visualization.
    * Verification:
        * The visualization is visually appealing and easy to understand.
        * Node and edge styles are consistent and informative.
        * Color palette and typography are accessible.

* **Task 1.4: Node Interaction Animations**

    * Description: Add subtle animations to provide feedback when users interact with nodes.
    * Target File: `src/components/KGVisualizationPanel.tsx`
    * Micro-processes:

        1.  Hover Effect:
            * When the user hovers the mouse over a node, slightly scale up the node size or change its color intensity.
            * Use a smooth transition for this effect (e.g., `transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;` in CSS).
        2.  Click Effect:
            * When the user clicks on a node to trigger the drill-down, briefly highlight the node with a pulsing effect or a color flash.
            * Consider a subtle scaling animation as well.
        3.  Node Expansion (if applicable):
            * If node details are displayed within the graph itself (e.g., expanding the node), animate the expansion smoothly.
            * This might involve increasing the node's size and fading in the detail elements.
    * Verification:
        * Node hover and click effects are smooth and responsive.
        * Animations provide clear feedback to the user.
        * Animations are not distracting or overwhelming.

* **Task 1.5: Node Progress Indicators (Placeholder)**

    * Description: Add visual placeholders to nodes to represent a student's progress on the underlying concept. This is a UI-only placeholder for now, with no actual data binding.
    * Target File: `src/components/KGVisualizationPanel.tsx`
    * Micro-processes:

        1.  Node Modification:
            * Modify the node rendering logic to include a placeholder for progress visualization.
            * This could involve:
                * Adding a circular progress bar within the node.
                * Changing the fill color of a portion of the node (e.g., a pie chart effect).
                * Adding an overlay element that represents completion (e.g., a checkmark or a progress percentage).
        2.  Visual Styles:
            * Define CSS classes or React component styles to control the appearance of the progress indicator.
            * Use a color gradient to represent progress (e.g., from red to green).
        3.  Placeholder Data:
            * For now, use placeholder data (e.g., a random number or a fixed percentage) to demonstrate the visual effect.
            * This will allow us to refine the UI without needing backend integration.
        4.  Accessibility:
            * Ensure that the progress indicator is accessible to users with visual impairments (e.g., provide alternative text or ARIA attributes)[cite: 454, 455, 456, 457, 458].
    * Verification:
        * Nodes display the progress indicator placeholder correctly.
        * The visual representation of progress is clear and intuitive.
        * The UI is accessible.

        3.  Node Selection Logic:
            * Determine which nodes are within the lassoed area.
            * Update the UI to visually indicate the selected nodes (e.g., highlighting, changing color).
        4.  "Create Lesson" Button:
            * Add a button or UI element that becomes active when nodes are selected.
            * When clicked, this button triggers the lesson creation process.
        5.  State Management:
            * Use Zustand to manage the state of the selected nodes[cite: 324, 325, 326, 327].
    * Verification:
        * Test drawing a lasso to select nodes.
        * Verify that the correct nodes are selected and highlighted.
        * Ensure that the "Create Lesson" button is enabled only when nodes are selected.

* **Task 2.2: Backend API Enhancement (Lesson Generation)**

    * Description: Implement the backend API endpoint and logic to generate a lesson based on the selected nodes.
    * Target File: `graphrag_tutor/api_server.py`, `graphrag_tutor/generation/lesson_generator.py` (new file).
    * Micro-processes:

        1.  API Endpoint Creation:
            * Create a new API endpoint (e.g., `/lessons/generate`) that accepts a list of node IDs as input.
        2.  Lesson Generation Logic:
            * Create a new module (`lesson_generator.py`) to handle the lesson generation logic.
            * This module will:
                * Fetch the details of the selected nodes from the knowledge graph.
                * Use the LLM Generator to create lesson content (definitions, explanations, examples, practice questions) based on the node information.
                * Structure the lesson content in a clear and organized format.
        3.  Data Transformation:
            * Ensure the API returns the lesson content in a structured format (e.g., JSON) that the frontend can easily display.
